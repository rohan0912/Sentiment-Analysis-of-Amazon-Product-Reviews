# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Amazon-Product-Reviews

## Abstract 
This project explores the complex process of sentiment analysis within the context of Amazon product reviews. Our team's endeavor was to harness the rich data contained in customer feedback to glean insights pivotal for businesses in enhancing their offerings and comprehending customer preferences. Through the deployment of advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the sentiments embedded in textual reviews. Simultaneously, we embarked on a systematic exploration of patterns and trends to extract practical intelligence for product improvement and targeted marketing tactics. Anchoring our research is the question of how the sentiment scores derived from textual reviews align with the numerical ratings provided by customers. This inquiry aims to bridge the gap between qualitative feedback and quantitative evaluation, offering a nuanced understanding of customer satisfaction and its implications for product success.


Analyzing customer reviews and ratings for products on Amazon, how they provided sentiment scores of the text reviews correlate with the numerical ratings given?

This project work is pivotal in leveraging big data to utilize customer feedback effectively. This analysis is vital in an era dominated by e-commerce, where customer reviews significantly influence purchasing decisions.
